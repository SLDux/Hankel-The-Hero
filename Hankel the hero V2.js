I smile to myself, I was making good progress today, surely it wouldn’t be much longer before I reach the city.","\n","^I feel a thrill run through me and my smile widens, some part of me still can’t believe that I am finally on my way, I’ve been dreaming about this for months and now I’m finally here, almost. My stomach tightens at the thought, nerves making me feel queasy but I push it down.","\n","^“So lad, what brings you out this way? You hunting for some adventure?” The man beside me, the cart’s driver asks.","\n","^“Oh, yes. I suppose.” I say dragged from my thoughts. “Thank you for picking me up.” I add “It would have been a long walk.”","\n","^“You must have good luck.” He smiles politely and nods to the back of the cart, where his wife and young son sit, dozing. “We only came this way because the other road was flooded, if it hadn’t you’d been walking for sure.”","\n","^I thank the man, he seems the chatty type, but nice enough I suppose. I smile, and he seems to approve.","\n","^“Think nothing of it, what kind of a man would I be if I left a kid stranded by the roadside? It just wouldn’t be right. Say, what brings a lad your age to the city anyway? You can’t be much older than my kid there.”","\n","^“I’m thirteen.” I say, annoyed, in truth I’m fairly tall for my age, but quite skinny with weak spindly limbs and no strength whatsoever. My father used to say that the only exciting thing about me was the red colour in my hair. I lift my chin in defiance. “I’m going to join a heroes guild.”","\n","^“A hero?” The man looks me up and down. He keeps a straight face at least, though I see the corner of his mouth twitching. “Well I wish you the best of luck.”","\n","^The road goes deeper into the forest, and sleet falls from the sky.","\n","^Up ahead, there is the sound of a mighty creaking and cracking as a tree suddenly falls across the road with a ground shaking thud.","\n","^The horse pulls to a sudden stop, snorting and huffing it shakes it’s head, trying to reverse down the road.","\n","^Behind me someone screams at the sudden crash.","\n","^“Oh curses.” Mutters the man, trying to pull the nag back into line.","\n","^I turn my head sharply as the wind blows, and I catch the foul stench of refuse and unwashed bodies coming from the trees. My stomach twists and flutters in panic as with great thumping footsteps a troll emerges. …Two trolls, another stepping out behind us.","\n","^Trolls, I’d only ever seen one before. Back in my home village, an old troll took to living under one of the outer bridges, stealing sheep and occasionally shepherds. The smell was something you never forgot.","\n","^I shudder, suddenly feeling very cold, despite the sweat breaking out on my forehead. Behind me I hear someone start to whimper.","\n","^“W-W-What are you d-doing?” The man beside me stammers, his voice trembling along with the rest of him.","\n","^The trolls ignore him, the one in front, tall and wide, wearing some kind of patchwork leather clothing over his rock like skin, walks towards the wagon, a large sac slung over his shoulder.","\n","^The horse pulls frantically at its reigns and straps as the troll nears.","\n","^I can practically feel my stomach curdle as the troll steps nearer and the smell of it wafts over me. Someone behind me retches. I try not to breathe.","\n","^The horses shrieks get so loud they hurt my ears, then the sounds suddenly stop as a troll snaps the animals neck with its bear hands. My body goes still, and I can no longer think, or process what I’m seeking, I am frozen in sudden terror, my mind blank.","\n","^The trolls ignores the sobs and wails as they grab whatever is in the back of the wagon and stuff it into their enormous sack, muttering to each other in some strange mangled language I don’t understand. One of them even grabs my backpack. The other troll, cuts the dead horse free from its straps and slings the carcass over his shoulder.","\n","^The pair spend another moment arguing, one of them gestures to the forest and I feel hopeful that they might just leave with what they have, but the other angrily points back at the wagon, holding up one finger.","\n","^The scene doesn’t make sense to me, until one of the trolls marches back to the wagon, where the woman and the young boy are huddled together, and after a moment of apparent consideration the troll grabs the young boy’s ankle and pulls him away. I watch, shocked, horrified, as the boy is ripped free from his mother’s grip and dragged away.","\n","^Something in me burns at the sight, a spark of something hot, injustice perhaps.","\n","^This isn’t right. The thought flares up in me, melting away the fear I feel injustice, indignation, anger. I watch his parents sobbing quietly, their heads in their hands, resigned.","\n","^This isn’t right.","\n","^Despite the fear still twisting my stomach in knots, I stand.","\n","^“Wait!” I call out, and to my surprise the trolls actually stop. Panic rises within me, and I feel my limbs start to shake, my breathing quicken. What are you doing? I tell myself. What can I do against a troll? I clench my fists.","\n","^“Leave the boy. You won’t get much meat him from, he’s scrawny, and you already have the horse.” The troll looks at me and I grow pale, but hold his eyes.","\n","^“Not for meat. For selling.” The troll says.","\n","^“But then…” I say, trying to think fast. “You probably wont get much for him either, he doesn’t look very strong…” The troll still stares me at and I feel sweat trickle down my face. “You’ll probably get more for the wagon if you sold it to some-”","\n","^“Take him!” The boy’s father says.","\n","^I turn my head to stare at him, unbelieving.","\n","^“Take the other boy, just leave our son alone.” I open my mouth to speak, but the man pushes me off the wagon, and I feel a sudden throbbing pain in the back of my head as my vision goes blurry.  I see the two trolls lumbering towards me as my vision goes black.","\n","ev","str","^Next","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Prelude_meeting"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Prelude_meeting":[["^The next few weeks, pass in a blur, I can barely feel the passing of time.

In the time I had been working with Eilim I had done nothing but clean. It’s not that I wasn’t grateful, but I wasn’t exactly progressing much in my journey to be a hero. I was still a weakling.","\n","^“Hankel! Hankel get up here!”","\n","^I can hear Eilim calling for me from his upstairs study. Sighing once more, I grab my mop and start for the stairs.","\n","^“And bring your mop with you.” I smile ruefully, wondering what happened this time.","\n","^His office is a mess. Books, papers, unwashed dishes and magical instruments haphazardly strewn about the room.","\n","^I still didn’t really know what Eilim did. I had gathered from his stories that he was centuries old, and I knew he was some kind mage, but any more than that I still didn’t know.","\n","^“What do you want?” I ask, glancing cautiously around the room.","\n","^“Bring me the mop.” Eilim says, holding out his hand and wiggling his fingers impatiently.","\n","^I hand it over, puzzled but silent, it was clear he was in the middle of some sort of project.","\n","^“Have you done what I asked?”","\n","^“Yes.” I hesitate. “But if I might ask, what does mopping every day have to do with being a hero?”","\n","^I can see him smiling. For some reason it makes me annoyed.","\n","^“You’ve told me your dream was to be a hero, yes? But you are unable. Why?”","\n","^I glare at him. “I’m not strong enough to be hero, I’m practically helpless. Is mopping supposed to teach some secret martial art or something?”","\n","^“Don’t be stupid.” Eilim says. I can see him tracing his fingers over it the mop in some pattern, muttering strange words.","\n","^After several long minutes, he takes off the mop head, and gives me the handle like a staff. “There, that’ll do it.”  He smiles, clearly tired. Without a word, he places one hand on my head and closing his eyes, mutters a few final words, before opening them again.","\n","^“What is this?”","\n","^“A gift.” He says, ignoring my growing irritation. “With this you should make a mighty hero. I’ve done my bit, now I’m sure you’ll rise to the challenge.”","\n","^I just stare at him, eyebrows raised.","\n","^“It might take a moment, and there could be a few side effects, so you might want to go and lie down.” He pats me on the head, and I leave the room, confusion warring with annoyance. Gritting my teeth, I hurry back downstairs.","\n","^What was that? I don’t feel any different. What had he done? For the six months I’ve been here, he’s been practically useless. He say he’ll turn me into a hero, but stays in room all day, he hasn’t taught me anything!","\n","^I mutter angrily as I storm across the room. I kick at the mop bucket, half expecting to stub my toe.","\n","^But to my surprise the bucket shatters into splinters, and soapy water sloshes across the floor. Taking a step, I slip and fall, bashing my head against the floor.","\n","^I lay there, stunned. Had I gotten stronger? I hadn’t been able to kick anything that hard yesterday. Did Eilim’s magic do something? I grin, annoyance forgotten, rubbing the back of my head, where I suddenly realise, it didn’t hurt. It should have hurt.","\n","^“Are you alright?” A voice asks me.","\n","^“Yes. Surprisingly. Maybe whatever Eilim did make me tougher as well?”","\n","^“Oh I hope so!” Says the strange voice.","\n","^I look around. There’s no one there.","\n","^“Who are you?”","\n","^“I am your mighty weapon!” The voice says enthusiastically. “I will help you become a great hero.”","\n","^Realisation dawns on me, and I stare at the mop handle now lying on the floor.","\n","^“What?”","\n","^“I am unbreakable.”","\n","^“Huh?”","\n","^“And I can do magic!”","\n","^“WHAT?”","\n","^“Ah, you’re in shock.” The mop says again.
