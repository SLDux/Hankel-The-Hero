I feel a thrill as the wooden cart bumps and rattles through the forest toward the city. I've been dreaming about this trip for months, but I still can't believe that it's finally happening. It could all go wrong of course, and I feel queasy at the thought but I push the feeling down.","\n","^“So lad, what brings you out this way? You off on some adventure?” The cart’s driver asks beside me.","\n","^“I suppose.” I say dragged from my thoughts. “Thanks for giving me a ride.” I add, smiling at the man.","\n","^“You must have good luck.” He says smiling back. He nods to the back of the cart, where his wife and son sit, dozing. “We only came this way because the other road was flooded, it's a long walk from here to town.”","\n","^\"Thank you.\" I say looking down at the road. He seems to be a nice man.","\n","^“Who would I be if I left a kid stranded on the roadside?\" He asks laughing. \"It just wouldn’t be right. How old are you?\" He frowns as he looks at me. \"and what brings a kid like you to the city anyway?\"","\n","^“I’m thirteen.” I say, annoyed. Though in truth I never really looked my age. I was tall, but skinny and weak, with slender arms and features that didn't suit my face. I lift my chin in defiance. “I’m going to join a hero guild.”","\n","^“You want to be a hero?” The man looks me up and down and I see him trying not to smile. “Well, I wish you luck.”","\n","^The road goes deeper into the forest, and sleet falls from the sky, the cold stinging my face.","\n","^Up ahead, there is the sound of a mighty creaking and cracking as a tree falls across the road with a ground shaking thud. The horse pulls to a sudden stop, snorting and huffing and shaking its head as it tries to reverse down the road.","\n","^“Oh curses.” Mutters the driver, tugging at the reigns.","\n","^I turn my head, smelling something on the wind. The foul stench of refuse and unwashed bodies. My stomach twists in panic as with great thumping footsteps a troll emerges from the trees. Two trolls! Another stepping out to block the road behind us.","\n","^I’d only seen a troll once before, back in the village. It took to living under one of the outer bridges, stealing sheep and occasionally shepherds. The smell was something you never forgot.","\n","^I shudder, suddenly feeling very cold, despite the my sweaty forehead. Behind me I hear the driver's family start to whimper and sob.","\n","^“W-W-What are you d-doing?” The driver stammers, visibly trembling.","\n","^The trolls ignore him, walking towards the cart, a large sac slung over one shoulder.","\n","^My stomach churns as the troll steps nearer and the smell of it wafts over me, behind me, someone retches.","\n","^The horse pulls frantically at the reigns, its desperate shrieks get so loud they hurt my ears. The horses shrieks suddenly stop as one of the trolls snaps the animal's neck.","\n","^I go still. I can no longer think or process what I’m seeking. I am frozen in terror, my mind blank.","\n","^The trolls ignore the frightened sobs as they grab whatever they can reach from the cart and stuff it into their enormous sack, muttering to each other in some strange mangled language I don’t understand. One of them even grabs my backpack. They cut the dead horse free from the cart and sling the carcass over a shoulder.","\n","^The pair spend another moment arguing, one of them gestures to the forest and I feel hopeful that they might just leave with what they have, but the other angrily points back at the cart.","\n","^The scene doesn’t make sense to me, until one of the trolls walks back to where the woman and the young boy are huddled together, and after a moment of apparent thought the troll grabs the young boy’s ankle and pulls him away.","\n","^I pity the boy as they rip him free from his mother’s grip. But then, something in me begins to burn at the sight. This isn’t right. The thought flares up in me like a fire and I feel angry as his parents sob quietly, their heads in their hands. This isn’t right. Despite the fear still twisting my stomach into knots, I stand.","\n","^“Wait!” I call out, and to my surprise the trolls actually stop. I feel my panic rising, and my limbs start to shake. What are you doing? I ask myself. What can I do against a troll? I clench my fists.","\n","^“Leave the boy. You already have the horse.”","\n","^The troll looks at me and I grow pale, but meet his eyes.","\n","^“Horse for eating. Boy for selling.” The troll says simply and I feel my heart sink.","\n","^“Then…” I say, trying to wrack my brain.","\n","^“Take him!” The driver says pointing at me.","\n","^I stare at him, eyes wide. I feel my stomach sinking, as a cold dread hits me.","\n","^“Take the other boy, just leave our son alone.” I open my mouth to speak, but the man pushes me off the wagon, and I hit the ground with a sudden pain in the back of my head. I see the trolls lumbering towards me as my vision goes black.","\n","ev","str","^Next","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Prelude_meeting"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Prelude_meeting":[["^Location: Parts unknown","\n","^Time passes in a blur. I don't where I am or where they are taking me but we are far from the city and lands that I know. I feel the initial fear and sharp stabbing panic slowly fade, turning into a dull and terrible dread. I don't know what's going to happen to me. I shouldn't be here. Forget being a hero, I should never have left home. Dread turns into misery and frustration. What business did I have trying to be a hero? I couldn't do anything to help. I only got myself into more trouble.","\n","^Eventually the trolls stop in some strange town filled with goblin creatures and the lack of friendly human faces makes me uneasy. The trolls bearly speak a word as they sell their items, leaving me tied me up in a simple wooden cage.","\n","^I can't help but feel afraid again, sitting and waiting for something unpleasant to happen. Odd Goblin men come and peer at me, muttering to themselves as I huddle in the wooden cage, trying to keep away from their prodding fingers. The only thing I can do is try to not cry.","\n","^I am surprised one day to see a man peering at me through the wooden cage. He watches me for a long moment and I find myself glaring at him in stubborn defiance. He is an elven man I note, hood pulled low over his pointed ears. He examines me for a long time, and eventually smiles. \"I'll take him off your hands.\" Says the stranger, tossing a bag of coin to the trolls.","\n","^The trolls let me go, and uncertain, I go with the strange man, who tells me his name is Eilim. He takes me to an inn where I wash and eat and asks me how I got here. My body clean and stomach full, I feel like I owe him that much at least, so I tell him of my ill-fated quest to become a hero. My cheeks colour with embarrassment as he raises his eyebrows. \"It doesn't matter,\" I say quickly, before he tells me what I already know. \"I'm too weak to be a hero, I can't save anyone.\"","\n","^\"You saved that boy didn't you?\"","\n","^\"Look where it got me.\" I grumble, but I feel a little better thinking of the boy.","\n","^After a long moment Eilim smiles, \"You're right, you have the body of a weakling.\"","\n","^I frown at him, annoyed.","\n","^\"But I think I can help with that.\" He holds out his hand. \"You come and work for me and I'll turn you into a real hero.\"","\n","^I look at him, for a long moment, but I can't hold back my smile.","\n","^\"Hankel\" I say shaking his hand. \"My name is Hankel\"","\n","ev","str","^Next","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Prelude_later"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Prelude_later":[["^Location: Eilim's house, six months later","\n","^I drop the mop into the bucket and sigh. Since I've been working with Eilim I've done nothing but clean. This isn't what I signed up for.","\n","^“Hankel! Hankel get up here!” Eilim calls for me from his upstairs study.","\n","^Wondering what he's done this time, I grab my mop, sighing once more, and start for the stairs.","\n","^Inside his office, books, papers, unwashed dishes and magical instruments are haphazardly strewn about the room. I still don't know what Eilim really does. I had agreed to help with his experiments, and I knows he's a mage of some kind, but he doesn't really explain much.","\n","^“What do you want?” I ask, glancing cautiously around the room.","\n","^“Bring me the mop.” Eilim says, holding out his hand and wiggling his fingers impatiently.","\n","^I hand it over, puzzled but silent, it was clear he was in the middle of a project.","\n","^“Have you done what I asked?”","\n","^“Yes,” I hesitate. “But what does mopping every day have to do with being a hero?” I can see him smiling, and it makes me annoyed.","\n","^“You said your dream was to be a hero, yes? But you are not strong enough.”","\n","^I glare at him. “And is mopping supposed to teach some secret martial art or something?”","\n","^“Don’t be daft.” Eilim says, tracing his fingers over the mop in twisting patterns, muttering. After several long minutes, he takes off the mop head, and gives me the handle like a staff. “There, that’ll do it.” He smiles, but is clearly tired. Without a word, he places one hand on my head and closing his eyes, mutters a few final words.","\n","^“What is this?”","\n","^“A gift.” He says, ignoring my growing irritation. “With this you should make a mighty hero. I’ve done my bit, now I’m sure you’ll rise to the challenge.”","\n","^I just stare at him, eyebrows raised.","\n","^“It'll take a moment.\" He says, patting me on the head. \"And there will be a few side effects, so you might want to go and lie down.”","\n","^I leave the room, confusion warring with annoyance. Gritting my teeth, I hurry back downstairs.","\n","^What was that? I don’t feel any different. What had he done? For the six months I’ve been here, he’s been practically useless. He say he’ll turn me into a hero, but stays in room all day, he hasn’t taught me anything!","\n","^I mutter angrily as I storm across the room. I kick at the mop bucket, half expecting to stub my toe.","\n","^But to my surprise the bucket shatters into splinters, and soapy water sloshes onto the floor. Taking a step, I slip and fall, bashing my head.","\n","^I lay still, stunned. Have I gotten stronger? I hadn’t been able to kick anything that hard yesterday. Did Eilim’s magic do something? I grin, annoyance forgotten, rubbing the back of my head, where I suddenly realise, it doesn’t hurt. It really should hurt.","\n","^“Are you alright?” A voice asks me.","\n","^“Yes, surprisingly. Maybe whatever Eilim did makes me tougher as well?”","\n","^“Oh I hope so!” Says the voice.","\n","^I look around, but there’s no one there.","\n","^“Who are you?”","\n","^“I am your mighty weapon!” The voice says enthusiastically. “I will help you become a great hero.”","\n","^Realisation dawns on me, and I stare at the mop handle now lying on the floor.","\n","^“What?”","\n","^“I am unbreakable.”","\n","^“Huh?”","\n","^“And I can do magic!”","\n","^“WHAT?”","\n","^“Ah, you’re in shock.” The mop says again.

Thick snake-like vines, like those covering the temple above, lay around the tunnel quivering and slithering about as if they were alive.

Looking closer at one, I grimace. I can see the grey lifeless skin of one arm melding into tree bark at the shoulder, and slithering vines growing out of the back, also, on the face is unmistakeably a human eye, a dead eye.

The vines, cold and slimy on unpleasant on my skin.","\n","^Raising my head, I look for the others. I see Gabor beside me, his body nearly encased in swarming vines. He struggles but it’s clearly no use.","\n","^My heart races, panic building. I crane my neck, glancing frantically around the room. Where is my staff?","\n","^Across the room I see a man dressed in druids robes, standing with his back to me, bent over a worktable, running his hands over my staff. A sudden terror fills me and my blood turns cold. I feel helpless.","\n","^I take a breath, composing myself and allow my frustration to fuel my anger.","\n","^“Your hospitality is wanting.” I say to the druid, who quickly turns.","\n","^The druid is younger than I expect, not even in his middle age, but looks pale, gaunt, and sickly.  His surprise lasts only for a moment, then he smiles. It looks unnatural on him. “I’m afraid I don’t get many visitors.” The druid admits. “But I’m very glad that you stopped by today. You and your companions will very useful to my research.”","\n","^“I think I met your research.” I say, not bothering to hide my disgust. “Your creatures outside.”","\n","^He nods. “A failed attempt. I considered disposing of them, but…” He shrugs. “They have proven useful.”","\n","^I glare him, my hatred building. He seems proud of his work, almost like a child boasting, expecting praise. It makes me sick.","\n","^“It’s no wonder the druids expelled you from the order.” I guess. “They don’t take kindly to necromancy.”","\n","^I can feel the druids anger form across the room. The vines around me loosen slightly as the druid looses control of his temper. He calms himself, but the vines do not tighten.","\n","^“My...colleges,” the druid says through gritted teeth, “threw me out long before I started my experiments. Their vision was too limited, they thought my goals were inappropriate.”","\n","^“Power, or immortality?” I ask.","\n","^The druid smiles another unpleasant smile. “A little of both. But it’s recognition that I seek.” He admits. “I want them to admit that I am better than they are. I want them to admit that they were wrong.”","\n","^I frown at him. “Is that really it?” I ask, my tone mocking “Was it revenge and justice that drove you here? Or just the fear of being wrong?”","\n","^“They rejected me!”","\n","^“So what? You think this will help?” I say, nodding to the room.","\n","^“Stop it.” He clenching his fists. “What do you know? The ridicule, the insults, those old men and their small ideas! They brag about their skill and their vision, but they’re just afraid.”","\n","^“And you’re afraid of becoming like them.”","\n","^I almost feel sorry for this man. Sorry for who had once been. A young, talented student full of promise. But now he was just afraid, afraid of being made obsolete.","\n","^My bonds loosen again in his anger and I try slowly pulling myself free. I glance at Gabor, still struggling. The angry druid to my horror grabs the staff from the worktable, holding it outstretched. A chill runs through me.","\n","^“I’m so glad you came to me today.” The druid says. “I’ve been wanting to look at your enchantment for a long time.”","\n","^A door opens and a man walks in, He appears to be a half-elf of middle years. His eyes widen when he sees Gabor, and then he glances at me, frowning.","\n","^“Ah, enchanter.” The druid says, smiling.","\n","^The half-elf looks unimpressed. “How am I supposed to finish my work if you keep interrupting?” He says, eyes drifting towards Gabor.","\n","^The druid gestures to me with a wave of his hand. “I’m sure you’ve heard of Hankel and his extraordinary skills. How much do you know about them? You are the best enchanter in the city, can you replicate them?”","\n","^The enchanter looks at me, raising his eyebrows, then he shakes his head. “I am not familiar with the enchantment. I have never met the man before. I am flattered that you think so highly of me, but I cannot help you.”","\n","^I frown. His eyes watch me, and it’s as if he’s addressing me and not the druid.","\n","^He looks back to the druid.","\n","^“As per the agreement” The enchanter says, contempt in his voice. “I shall finish my work.” He turns to leave, but the druid’s puts a hand on his shoulder.","\n","^“Stay a while, you will find this interesting.” The druid holding my staff, caresses it greedily. He closes his eyes.","\n","^I tug harder at my bonds, trying to free myself.","\n","^The druid opens his eyes, a look of outrage on his face.","\n","^“What is wrong with it?” He demands, gripping the staff so tightly, I fear it might crack. “What have you done to it?” He leans closer, shouting and spitting in my face.","\n","^Suddenly, I feel the vines loosen again.","\n","^Gritting my teeth, with a sudden motion, I throw my head forwards, slamming it into the druid’s nose. He drops the staff and it clatters to the floor. He staggers back, cursing and clutching his face.","\n","^The druid retreats to the corner of the room. He laughs, “I used to admire you, you know. I was fascinated by you.” The man lowers his hands and I see his bloody smile. “I wanted so badly to test your skills, to know how they worked, so I send someone to find out. He disappointed me in the end, got himself killed. But you know, Sundrian’s are a bloodthirsty lot.”","\n","^I freeze recognising the word. Memories come rushing back. A building in flames. A city burning. Screams ringing in my ears. Falling to my knees, in burning rubble.","\n","^“I didn’t mean for it to go as far as it did.” The druid says, backing away towards the wall. “I didn’t want him to kill everybody.” He shrugs, as if it’s a minor issue.","\n","^“But, this?” He sneers at me, looking at me with contempt. “This is new low. The great hero, and his unbreakable staff, are now nothing more than an old man and his walking stick.”","\n","^Full of rage, I burst free from my restraints just as the druid reaches the far wall.
